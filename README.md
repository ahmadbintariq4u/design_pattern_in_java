**Designing a Object-Oriented software is hard but Designing a Reusable Object-Oriented software is even harder**

_A pattern consists of following things;_
1. Name
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Consequences

Patterns can have either;
1. Creational _(concern with the process of object creation)_
2. Structural _(concern with the composition of classes and objects)_
3. Behavioral _(concern with the interaction and responsibilities between the classes and objects)_
